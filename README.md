# spatialNetherlandsprecipitation
Spatial Modelling of Netherlands precipitation

The dataset contains 220 measurements of total monthly precipitation in the Netherlands in September 2019. This dataset was downloaded from the Copernicus Climate Data Store [1]. In the dataset, each row contains a station name, longitude and latitude of the observation station, and total precipitation for the month in millimetres.

The work will identify the spatial relationships seen in the data, model the precipitation and the spatial variations and predict precipitation at 3 random locations. Three methods are used to predict: variogram, Gaussian Process model using maximum likelihood, and Bayesian model.
